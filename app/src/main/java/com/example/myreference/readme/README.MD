This Project will start out as a one stop place to get a reference to all many
of the tasks that are carried out in android. Each package will most likely be it's own miniproject
However projects will be able to naviagate to each other, but it will made explicit when doing so.

Also certain features such as dependency injection and architecture will feature in every miniproject
However the projects focusing on them will have simpler use cases and more notations
